### 📋 Feature Flag Viewing

#### `list_features` ⭐ *Most commonly used*
**What it does:** Shows all feature flags in an instance, with their status in a specific environment

**When to use:**
- Daily feature flag management
- Checking what features are enabled in production
- Getting an overview of all your feature flags
- Seeing which features are stale or need attention

**Parameters:**
- `instance` (required): Which Unleash server (e.g., "production", "staging")
- `project` (optional): Project name (uses default if not specified)
- `environment` (optional): Which environment to show status for (uses instance default)

**Example output:**
```
Feature flags in production (default project) - production environment:

Found 3 feature flag(s):
- Active: 2
- Disabled: 1
- Archived: 0
- Stale: 0

**new-checkout-flow** (release) ✅ ENABLED
Description: New checkout flow with improved UX
Project: default
Environments: development: ✅, staging: ✅, production: ✅
Created: 1/15/2025
---

**beta-features** (experiment) ❌ DISABLED
Project: default
Environments: development: ✅, staging: ❌, production: ❌
Created: 1/10/2025
⚠️ STALE
---
```

**💡 Tip:** This is your go-to tool for checking feature flag status. It shows environment-specific status, which is usually what you need.

#### `get_feature_status`
**What it does:** Gets detailed information about one specific feature flag

**When to use:**
- Investigating a specific feature flag
- Checking strategies and detailed configuration
- Troubleshooting why a feature isn't working as expected

**Parameters:**
- `instance` (required): Which Unleash server
- `name` (required): Exact feature flag name
- `project` (optional): Project name
- `environment` (optional): Show detailed info for specific environment

**Example output:**
```
**new-checkout-flow** (release) ✅ ENABLED
Description: New checkout flow with improved UX
Project: default
Environments: development: ✅, staging: ✅, production: ✅
Created: 1/15/2025

**production Environment Details:**
Status: ✅ ENABLED
Strategies: 2 configured
```

#### `list_all_features` ⚠️ *Advanced use only*
**What it does:** Shows feature flags with their global status (not environment-specific)

**When to use:**
- Rarely needed - only when you specifically need global status
- Most users should use `list_features` instead

**Parameters:**
- `instance` (required): Which Unleash server
- `project` (optional): Project name

**Why you probably don't need this:** Global status can be confusing because a feature might be globally "disabled" but still enabled in specific environments. Use `list_features` for clearer, more useful information.

### ⚙️ Feature Flag Management

#### `create_feature`
**What it does:** Creates a new feature flag and automatically disables it in all environments

**When to use:**
- Adding a new feature to your application
- Setting up a feature flag before development starts
- Creating experimental features

**Parameters:**
- `instance` (required): Which Unleash server
- `name` (required): Feature flag name (use kebab-case like "new-checkout-flow")
- `description` (optional but recommended): What this feature does
- `type` (optional): Type of feature - `release` (default), `experiment`, `operational`, `kill-switch`, or `permission`
- `project` (optional): Project name

**Safety feature:** The feature is automatically disabled in ALL environments when created, preventing accidental activation.

**Example output:**
```
✅ Feature flag 'new-checkout-flow' created successfully in production (default project) and disabled in all environments: development, staging, production
```

**💡 Best practices:**
- Use descriptive names: "new-checkout-flow" not "feature1"
- Always add a description explaining what the feature does
- Choose the right type: `release` for new features, `experiment` for A/B tests, `kill-switch` for emergency shutoffs

#### `toggle_feature` ⭐ *Very commonly used*
**What it does:** Enables or disables a feature flag in a specific environment

**When to use:**
- Enabling a feature in development for testing
- Promoting a feature from staging to production
- Quickly disabling a problematic feature
- Rolling out features gradually across environments

**Parameters:**
- `instance` (required): Which Unleash server
- `name` (required): Feature flag name
- `environment` (required): Which environment ("development", "staging", "production")
- `enabled` (required): `true` to enable, `false` to disable
- `project` (optional): Project name

**Example output:**
```
✅ ENABLED Feature flag 'new-checkout-flow' enabled in production environment (production - default project)
```

**💡 Common workflow:**
1. Create feature (automatically disabled everywhere)
2. Enable in development for testing
3. Enable in staging for QA
4. Enable in production when ready

#### `archive_feature`
**What it does:** Archives (soft deletes) a feature flag when you no longer need it

**When to use:**
- Cleaning up old feature flags
- Removing features that are now permanent
- Decluttering your feature flag list

**Parameters:**
- `instance` (required): Which Unleash server
- `name` (required): Feature flag name
- `project` (optional): Project name

**Example output:**
```
🗄️ Feature flag 'old-feature' archived successfully in production (default project)
```

**💡 Note:** Archived flags can be restored if needed, so this is safe to do.

### 🌍 Environment Management

#### `list_environments`
**What it does:** Shows all available environments in your Unleash instance

**When to use:**
- Learning what environments are available
- Checking environment configuration
- Seeing which environments are protected (require special permissions)

**Parameters:**
- `instance` (required): Which Unleash server
- `project` (optional): Project name

**Example output:**
```
Environments in production (default project):

**development** (development)
  Status: ✅ Enabled
  Protected: 🔓 No

**staging** (test)
  Status: ✅ Enabled
  Protected: 🔓 No

**production** (production)
  Status: ✅ Enabled
  Protected: 🔒 Yes
```

**💡 Understanding the output:**
- **Protected environments** (🔒) require special permissions to modify
- **Status** shows if the environment is active
- Use these exact environment names in `toggle_feature`

## Common Workflows

Here are the most common ways you'll use this server:

### 🚀 Creating and Rolling Out a New Feature

**Scenario:** You're adding a new checkout flow to your e-commerce site.

```bash
# 1. First, see what instances you have available
list_instances

# 2. Create the feature flag (automatically disabled everywhere for safety)
create_feature instance="production" name="new-checkout-flow" description="Improved checkout with one-click payments" type="release"

# 3. Enable in development for initial testing
toggle_feature instance="production" name="new-checkout-flow" environment="development" enabled=true

# 4. Check that it's working as expected
get_feature_status instance="production" name="new-checkout-flow"

# 5. Promote to staging for QA testing
toggle_feature instance="production" name="new-checkout-flow" environment="staging" enabled=true

# 6. After QA approval, enable in production
toggle_feature instance="production" name="new-checkout-flow" environment="production" enabled=true

# 7. Later, when the feature is stable and permanent, clean up
archive_feature instance="production" name="new-checkout-flow"
```

### 🔍 Daily Feature Flag Management

**Scenario:** You want to check the status of all your features.

```bash
# See what's currently enabled in production
list_features instance="production" environment="production"

# Check a specific feature that might be causing issues
get_feature_status instance="production" name="problematic-feature"

# Quickly disable it if there's a problem
toggle_feature instance="production" name="problematic-feature" environment="production" enabled=false
```

### 🧪 Managing Experiments

**Scenario:** You're running A/B tests and need to manage experimental features.

```bash
# Create an experiment
create_feature instance="production" name="homepage-redesign-test" description="A/B test for new homepage layout" type="experiment"

# Enable only in development first
toggle_feature instance="production" name="homepage-redesign-test" environment="development" enabled=true

# After testing, enable for a subset of production users (you'd configure targeting in Unleash UI)
toggle_feature instance="production" name="homepage-redesign-test" environment="production" enabled=true

# Check all your experiments
list_features instance="production" environment="production"
```

### 🚨 Emergency Feature Disable

**Scenario:** A feature is causing problems in production and needs to be disabled immediately.

```bash
# Quickly disable the problematic feature
toggle_feature instance="production" name="problematic-feature" environment="production" enabled=false

# Verify it's disabled
get_feature_status instance="production" name="problematic-feature"

# Check what other features might be affected
list_features instance="production" environment="production"
```

### 🏢 Multi-Instance Management

**Scenario:** You have separate Unleash instances for different teams or environments.

```bash
# Check what instances are available
list_instances

# Create the same feature in both staging and production instances
create_feature instance="staging" name="new-api-endpoint" description="New REST API endpoint for mobile app"
create_feature instance="production" name="new-api-endpoint" description="New REST API endpoint for mobile app"

# Test in staging first
toggle_feature instance="staging" name="new-api-endpoint" environment="development" enabled=true
toggle_feature instance="staging" name="new-api-endpoint" environment="staging" enabled=true

# After validation, enable in production instance
toggle_feature instance="production" name="new-api-endpoint" environment="production" enabled=true
```

## Understanding Multi-Instance & Multi-Environment Support

### Multiple Instances
You can connect to multiple Unleash servers simultaneously. Common setups:

- **Separate Staging/Production**: Different Unleash servers for different deployment stages
- **Team-Based**: Different instances for different teams or products
- **Geographic**: Different instances for different regions or data centers
- **Customer-Based**: Different instances for different customers (multi-tenant)

### Multiple Environments
Within each instance, you work with multiple environments:

- **development**: For local development and initial testing
- **staging/test**: For pre-production testing and QA
- **production**: For live features affecting real users
- **Custom environments**: Any additional environments you've configured

### Best Practices

**🎯 Feature Flag Naming:**
- Use descriptive, kebab-case names: `new-checkout-flow`, `mobile-app-redesign`
- Include the purpose: `experiment-homepage-layout`, `killswitch-payment-gateway`
- Avoid generic names: `feature1`, `test`, `new-thing`

**🔄 Rollout Strategy:**
1. **Create** feature (automatically disabled everywhere)
2. **Enable in development** for initial testing
3. **Enable in staging** for QA and integration testing
4. **Enable in production** when ready for users
5. **Archive** when feature is permanent or no longer needed

**🛡️ Safety Tips:**
- Features are created disabled by default - this prevents accidents
- Always test in development and staging before production
- Use `get_feature_status` to verify changes before and after
- Keep feature flags temporary - archive them when no longer needed

**⚡ Quick Operations:**
- Use `list_features` daily to see what's active
- Use `toggle_feature` for quick enable/disable operations
- Use `get_feature_status` when troubleshooting specific features
